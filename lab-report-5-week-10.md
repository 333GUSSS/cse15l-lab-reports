# CSE 15L: Lab Report 5 Week 10

## Repository Links

[My Repositiory](https://github.com/333GUSSS/markdown-parser)

(P.S: I downloaded the required markdown file I am comparing my repo to into my own repo but I put it as a directory called "cse15lsp22-markdown-parser", so whenever I wanted to run test in their repository I moved to that directory using the cd command.)

## How you found the tests with different results

I ran the command "time bash script.sh" in both repositories individually and piped the results into a txt file. Then I manually went to a line that had different result by having both txt file results side by side to easily compare the two.
